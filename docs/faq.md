# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## About the Dev Pods Program

### What is the Dev Pods Program?
The Dev Pods Program is an exclusive, invitation-only initiative designed to transform how organizations build software in the AI era. It's a six-month program that helps organizations establish internal communities of technical virtuosos (Black Belts) who will drive innovation for years to come.

### How is this different from regular technical training?
Unlike traditional training that focuses solely on individual skills, the Dev Pods Program creates self-sustaining centers of excellence within your organization. The program builds a community structure and knowledge architecture that continues delivering value long after the formal program concludes.

## Program Logistics

### How long is the program?
The Dev Pods Program runs for six months, with a carefully structured progression from foundational skills to advanced innovation.

### What is the time commitment required?
Participants typically dedicate 4-6 hours per week to program activities, including workshops, hands-on labs, and community building exercises. Black Belt candidates will invest additional time in leadership development and community facilitation.

### Is this program available globally?
Yes, the Dev Pods Program is available globally, with content currently provided in English, Portuguese, and Spanish. Additional language support is being developed.

## Participation & Requirements

### Who should participate in the program?
The program is ideal for organizations looking to elevate their development capabilities through AI-assisted productivity tools, community excellence, and modern development practices. Participants should have basic development experience.

### What technical prerequisites are there?
Participants should have foundational programming knowledge and experience with at least one programming language. No prior experience with GitHub Copilot or advanced AI tools is required.

### How many people from my organization should participate?
For optimal results, we recommend at least 15-20 developers participate, with 3-5 identified as potential Black Belt candidates who will lead your internal community after the program.

## Certification & Recognition

### What certifications are included?
Participants receive vouchers for official GitHub certifications, including GitHub Foundations, GitHub Copilot, and GitHub Advanced Security certifications.

### What is the Black Belt recognition?
The Black Belt designation recognizes individuals who have demonstrated both technical excellence and community leadership capabilities. These individuals become your internal champions who will lead your development excellence community.

### How are Black Belts selected?
Black Belt candidates are identified based on their technical proficiency, leadership potential, and community-building capabilities. They undergo additional training in facilitating technical communities and receive specialized recognition.

## Technical Content

### What technologies are covered?
The program covers Git, GitHub, GitHub Copilot, GitHub Advanced Security, as well as AI-assisted development practices across multiple programming languages including JavaScript, Python, and C#.

### Does the program focus on specific programming languages?
While the program includes language-specific modules for JavaScript, Python, and C#, the core principles and practices apply to development in any language environment.

### Will this program help with our legacy codebase?
Yes, the program includes modules on strategic migration engineering and AI-assisted maintenance that are specifically designed to improve work with existing codebases.

## Results & Outcomes

### What measurable outcomes can we expect?
Organizations completing the program typically report 40% faster onboarding of new developers, 63% reduction in critical production issues, and a 94% satisfaction rate among technical teams.

### How do we measure success?
The program includes built-in metrics tracking for key indicators like code quality, development velocity, and knowledge sharing. We'll help you establish baselines and track improvements throughout the program.

### What happens after the program ends?
The program is designed to create self-sustaining communities. After completion, your certified Black Belts will continue leading internal excellence communities, applying the frameworks and practices established during the program.
